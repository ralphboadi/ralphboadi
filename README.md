## Next Project
### Using Generative AI to mimic a real-world Oil & Gas Project as Analyst  
How I'll use Generative AI:
 -  Use Generative AI to create synthetic time-series data for oil wells, pumps, sensors, pressure, temperature, depth etc
  - Use Generative AI to generate predictive models that mimic real resrvoir or well behavior
  - Use Generative AI to write and optimize SQL or ETL scripts for complex joins, data cleansing or aggregations
  - Use AI to simulate operational changes like shut-ins, flowline leaks, equipment upgrades
  - Use **LLMS** to auto-explain dashboard insights, generate alert messages, or recommend actions
