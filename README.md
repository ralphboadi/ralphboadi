## Customer Segmentation Analysis (SQL + Power BI)/ Project 001a
This project focuses on segmenting customers using the Superstore dataset to uncover key patterns and high-value groups. The aim is to support targeted marketing, improve customer retention, and drive profitability through data-driven insights.

## 📌 About the Project

This project applies customer segmentation techniques to retail data using SQL and Power BI. By grouping customers based on total sales, profit, and order behavior, we uncover high-value segments that can help drive focused business strategies.

## 🧠 Segmentation Logic

Customers are segmented based on:

- 📈 **Total Sales**: Indicates purchasing power  
- 💰 **Total Profit**: Measures profitability  
- 🔁 **Order Count**: Reflects buying frequency  
- 🌍 **Region & Segment**: Business categorization

Using these, we assign each customer a segment label (e.g., Platinum, Gold, Silver) based on performance.
