## Results

| Group | Number of Users(n) | Conversions(x) | Conversion Rate |
|-------|--------------------|----------------|-----------------|
| A (n1) |  [245]            |  [22]        |  [.089796]    |
| B (n2) |  [256]            |  [33]        |  [0.128906]   |

## Statistical Test

We performed a z-test for two proportions to evaluate if the difference in conversion rates is statistically significant.

- Z-statistic: `-1.3998`
- P-value: `0.1616`

At a significance level of 0.05, the p-value is greater than 0.05, so:

> We fail to reject the null hypothesis. 
> There is no statistically significant difference in conversion rates between the original and new landing page.

## Interpretation

> Since the p-value (0.1616) is greater than 0.05, we fail to reject the null hypothesis.
> There is no statistically significant evidence that the new landing page (Group B) outperforms the original (Group A) in terms of conversion rate
