Here's what the t-test and chi-square test revealed:

T-Test(Numeric KPI's)
| KPI                 | t-Statistic | p-Value  | Statistically Significant? |
| ------------------- | ----------- | -------- | -------------------------- |
|   Pass Accuracy     | -13.97      | 4.16e-33 |   Yes (very significant)   |

Chi-Sqaure Test(Conversion Rate - Binary:Goal or No Goal)
| Metric                     | Value |
| -------------------------- | ----- |
| Chi-square statistic       | 2.29  |
| p-Value                    | 0.130 |
| Statistically Significant? |   No  |

Interpretation Summary
- Lightweight Ball (Group B) resulted in significantly:
    -Higher pass accuracy
    -More shots on target
    -More goals scored

- Conversion Rate (scoring yes/no) wasn't statistically significant (likely due to small number of goals overall)
- Possession % difference isnâ€™t significant
